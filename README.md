# Stuff should go here later, when this repo actually contains some code.

Default Menu:

    This theme requires a WordPress menu called "Default". To create it, go to
    Appearance - Menus - Create a New Menu. Name it "Default" and add links as
    appropriate.

    The homepage template looks for the Default manu and displays the first 3
    sections and the first 4 links in them in boxes under the main image.
